# Arithmetic Operations in Python

This document explains basic arithmetic operations in Python using variables `a` and `b`.

## Explanation of Operations
1. **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two numbers.
2. **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
3. **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two numbers.
4. **Division (`/`)**: Divides the first number by the second, returning a floating-point result.
5. **Modulus (`%`)**: Returns the remainder of the division.
6. **Exponentiation (`**`)**: Raises the first number to the power of the second.
7. **Floor Division (`//`)**: Performs division and rounds the result down to the nearest integer.

## Notes
- When using floor division (`//`), the result is always rounded down.
- If one of the numbers is negative in floor division, the result is also negative.
- Exponentiation is useful for calculating powers of numbers.
